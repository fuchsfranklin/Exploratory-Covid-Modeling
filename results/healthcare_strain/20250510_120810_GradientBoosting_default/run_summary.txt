Evaluation
----------
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on Test Set: 3.9595

Interpretation of MAE:
The MAE indicates that, on average, the model's predictions for 'icu_patients_per_million'
are off by approximately 3.9595 units from the actual values on the test set.
A lower MAE is generally better. This value should be contextualized against the typical range
and variability of 'icu_patients_per_million'. For example, if 'icu_patients_per_million' typically ranges from 0-100, an MAE of 3.9595 might be considered good.
